Banner advertisements will always align to the very top or bottom of the view.

Interstitials will always overlay the entire view.  

### [Usage](#usage)

To gain the most out of in-game advertisements, it is important to display them in at the correct times. The best implemented ads remain unobtrusive so as not to annoy or turn away players.

Note: only one ad should be displayed at any given time.

Abuse of ads from Clay.io may result in revoked ad access or a game takedown.

##### Banners  

These ads perform best when placed at the top or bottom of game menus. It's advised that banner ads not appear on the initial start screen, instead appearing in later menus.

Displaying these ads during gameplay is highly discouraged.

Do Not:

  - Obstruct buttons or icons with ads

Do:
  
  - Provide adequate padding between ads and in-game content

##### Interstitials  

These types of ads work best when displayed at the end of/in-between levels or plays. They should appear before the "game over" options (such as buttons to proceed to the next level) to avoid unintentional taps/clicks.

Do Not:

  - Display immediately, before any user interaction
  - Display mid-game play
  - Display consecutive ads within 60 seconds of each other
